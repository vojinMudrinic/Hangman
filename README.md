# App goal
The goal of the game is to guess hidden words and set a highscore before time runs out! When selecting correct letters, player is scoring +1 point. In a situation when a player starts making a streak of correct guesses, the streak adds to the current score. The streak is broken once the player selects the wrong letter or uses a hint to reveal letters.
